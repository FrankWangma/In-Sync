# In-Sync
In-Sync is a synchronised video watching web application, where you can enjoy YouTube videos with your friends!

The In-Sync web application is currently up and running, hosted using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 

You can visit the website at [https://in-sync-app.herokuapp.com/](https://in-sync-app.herokuapp.com/)

You can also hit the backend endpoints at [https://in-sync-app-backend.herokuapp.com/](https://in-sync-app-backend.herokuapp.com/)

# Getting Started

The application is comprised of two parts, the front end web application and the backend server, which are in separate directories in this repository. Both parts need to be running for the application to work properly.

Before everything, you can use `git clone https://github.com/FrankWangma/Group-4-Pink-Polar-Bear.git` to clone the repo into your current directory. From there, refer to the next two sections to set up and run the project.
